In the main file I am loading in the cards/assets needed for a card. Then the card file is made to handle the properties of a card. So it will help display the card's images as well as their back side when being placed down. Each suit will have a colir assigned to it which is either red or black. Each card has properties such as the suit and its value and when it face up or down. In this file the suit images are also placed onto the cards that are face up otherwise the backside image of the card is displayed. In the grabber file I will be making a function that helps the user "grab" the card which lets the user drag the card around the screen.
